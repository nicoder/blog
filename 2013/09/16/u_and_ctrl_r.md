# u and Ctrl-R

These are arguably the most important commands to know in Vim's normal mode.

It is easy in Vim to not type exactly the commands you wanted to and to get 
something unexpected on the screen.

That was one of the reasons I was a bit afraid of using Vim at work at the
beginning, I feared I might mess up the files unknowingly. Knowing that I could
(and should) read the diff before commiting helped me make the jump. But I
always keep an eye out for any unwanted change.

`u` ("undo") is your friend. It has yet to disappoint me.

For a long time I could not remember what the "redo" command was: `Ctrl-R`.
