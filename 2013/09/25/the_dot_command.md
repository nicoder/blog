# the dot command

The "dot command" (`.`) is maybe my favorite Vim command. I often have to do
the same operation in more than one place, and `.` repeats the last change.

Combine that with a search and after doing one change the following can be made
quickly with as many `n.` as needed.

Drew Neil started his _Practical Vim_ book with a description of that command.

What is fun is that you start to craft your changes so that they will be
repeatable with the `.` command. It becomes like recording a simple macro.
