# gt

It took me a long while to use tabs in Vim (while I used them a lot before in
Eclipse and Notepad++), and after that it took me a while to learn how to
navigate from one to the next with the keyboard (since I usually use gVim I 
would click on the tab to open it).

`gt` opens the next tab (the one on the right), `gT` the previous one.

Reading `:help gt` reminded me that `:tabnext` and `:tabprevious` have the same
effet as `gt` and `gT`.

As usual there is a lot of cool stuff to find in the help file : `:tabedit`,
`:tabclose`, `:tabfirst`, `:tablast`, `:tabonly`, `:tabdo`, `:tabmove`, ...
