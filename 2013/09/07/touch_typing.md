# Touch typing

I read this advice in Drew Neil's 'Practical Vim' book: If you want to be good
at using Vim, you had better know how to touch type.

It makes a lot of sense. Vim's commands can make editing text super fast (and
fun!).
But if you have to look for the keys to type the commands, you will be a lot
slower.
Or if you do not look at them but hit the wrong keys you will have to use `u` a
lot :)

So how do you learn to touch type?

I don't have a good answer to that question yet. I spent quite a lot of time 
practising in [GNU Typist](http://www.gnu.org/software/gtypist). I think it
helped a lot, but given the time I spent and my current level I am not sure it
is the best way to learn.

Here are two web apps I have tried a little:

[typeracer](http://play.typeracer.com/): typing a small text excerpt makes
your car advance and you race against other participants.

[typing.io](http://typing.io/): practise typing in open source code in a
variety of programming languages.

A way to progress is to force yourself to never look at the keyboard. I find I
still look at it when typing in passwords though.

A nice thing about practising with a tool like gtypist is that you can listen
to a podcast at the same time.
