# :only

A Vim command I use every day: when I have split windows, `:only` closes every
window except the one I am in.

Reading `:h :only` I learnt that `<Ctrl-W><Ctrl-O>` (or `<Ctrl-W>o`) does the
same thing. That is less to type so I guess I will change my habits :)

`:tabonly` does the same thing for tabs.
