# Ctrl-d

Here is a way of 'scrolling' the Vim window content I learned recently.

In normal mode, I knew of `Ctrl-F` to show the next 'page' (think 'forwards')
and `Ctrl-B` (think 'backwards') to show the previous 'page'.

Sometimes I would want to keep a bit of context, so I would first go to the
middle of the window with `M`, and then I would hit `Ctrl-F` or `Ctrl-B`.

It turns out `Ctrl-D` ('downwards') and `Ctrl-U` ('upwards') do just that, by
default they move the window half a page down and half a page up.

I typed `:help Ctrl-D` and find it fascinating how many commands exist...
