    21h32 "Something new for thirty days". I enjoyed that TED talk by Matt Cuts, and heard Ben Orenstein on the Giant Robots podcast this morning saying that if you're looking for a (better) job you should write a blog post every day.
    21h35 I am not looking for a (better) job at the moment, but I always figured I'd like to write a blog.
    21h37 My current career goal is as follows : I'd like to learn how to program well and then start teaching what I've learned.
    21h37 I may as well try and start sharing what I have learned, so I'll try to write a small post each day in September.
    22h20 wrote my `g;` post, next let's publish that in a new repo on github
    22h47 it's up! https://github.com/nicoder/blog/blob/master/2013/09/01/g_semicolon.md

    21h52 sixth post, not a vim command for once!
    21h52 still linked to vim in a way, and a more general lesson : when

    it / make it disappear

0927fri
    22h37 { and } to move
    05h58 oops, fell asleep.



ideas : 
gv to get the same visual selection (example, Ctrl-v to move a set of lines to the right, than gv and 10j to get 10 more lines and move once more)
* to go to the next occurrence of the word, # to go to the previous (notice the word delimiters in the search when do /<Up> or q/)
:windo diffthis
word boundaries in search, e.g. /\$f\> to search for `$f` variable and not get `$from` for example
w and b
:reg
podcasts i listen to
blogging (even if no one reads you, just writing about stuff will make you research it a bit and learn something)
reading mailing lists
list() in php to 'destructure' array returned by function
php use warnings!
code review
:b
editing a macro (qA and "ap/edit/"ax)
lowercase a word with guw
command line shortcuts (alt dot, Ctrl-t, Ctrl-a, Ctrl-e, Ctrl-u, alt-b and alt-f to go back/forward by a word, Ctrl-r)
0 to go to the beginning of the line. ^ to go to the first non whitespace character of the line
/
mappings (for example add a space before and after the character under the cursor. or my ,j and ,k to do page-down page-up in the next split window)
Ctrl-I to go forward in the jump list (I remember Ctrl-O but never Ctrl-I)
:! to launch a system command / another program. Ex: !phpunit %, !phpcs %
differences between $a + $b and array_merge($a, $b) in php
:tabclose : moyen de voir ensuite le tab de gauche au lieu de celui de droite?
how to paste a class name for example when searching with :Ack in the Vim command line
advantages of (loosely) limiting line width to 80 chars (diffs, more readable, forces to use variables (with intention revealing name)). drawbacks: more screen height used => but then pushes you to extract functions
:w filename.txt to save a visual selection to a file
color scheme and font (to force me to get better ones)
ctrlp! try it (saw it in chris hunt's talk, sort of like command-t and if i remember correctly it does not need ruby)
try to change my ,t mapping to execute the last test file if the current one is not a test file
put vimrc on github
