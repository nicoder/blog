    21h32 "Something new for thirty days". I enjoyed that TED talk by Matt Cuts, and heard Ben Orenstein on the Giant Robots podcast this morning saying that if you're looking for a (better) job you should write a blog post every day.
    21h35 I am not looking for a (better) job at the moment, but I always figured I'd like to write a blog.
    21h37 My current career goal is as follows : I'd like to learn how to program well and then start teaching what I've learned.
    21h37 I may as well try and start sharing what I have learned, so I'll try to write a small post each day in September.
    22h20 wrote my `g;` post, next let's publish that in a new repo on github
    22h47 it's up! https://github.com/nicoder/blog/blob/master/2013/09/01/g_semicolon.md

    21h52 sixth post, not a vim command for once!
    21h52 still linked to vim in a way, and a more general lesson : when
    21h53 something annoys you, try and find a way to understand / work around
    it / make it disappear

    21h32 seventh post: touch typing

0908sun
    21h21 eight post: Ctrl-V

0909mon
    21h20 ninth post: vim macros

ideas : 
q/
cw (along with n and .)
== (for example =i{ to indent body of a function or if statement)
ci"
%
/
f et t (et conjonction avec d, c, etc)
gUw
G and gg (example : dgg, dG)
u et Ctrl-R
:g/MY SEARCH STRING to show only those lines. e.g. :g/function => function definitions in php file
C (e.g changing elseif into else)
zz, zt and zb
:only to keep just one window open when split
:sort
:tabedit %:h/ + Tab
Ctrl-A et Ctrl-x, with count (e.g. to add 8 to three numbers)
I, A
. (dot commant). For example : `A[add something at the end of a line)` then go to another line and then `.` will add the same text at the end of the line
split windows : vs, Ctrl-W W, sp, Ctrl-W j k l, :q
{ and } to move
gv to get the same visual selection (example, Ctrl-v to move a set of lines to the right, than gv and 10j to get 10 more lines and move once more)
* to go to the next occurrence of the word, # to go to the previous (notice the word delimiters in the search quen do /<Up> or q/)
:windo diffthis
word boundaries in search, e.g. /\$f\> to search for `$f` variable and not get `$from` for example
w and b
:reg
podcasts i listen to
blogging (even if no one reads you, just writing about stuff will make you research it a bit and learn something)
reading mailing lists
list() in php to 'destructure' array returned by function
php use warnings!
code review
:b
Ctrl-A to go to begining of the line in shell. alt-b and alt-f to go a word back/forward
editing a macro (qA and "ap/edit/"ax)
