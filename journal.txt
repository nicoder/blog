    21h32 "Something new for thirty days". I enjoyed that TED talk by Matt Cuts, and heard Ben Orenstein on the Giant Robots podcast this morning saying that if you're looking for a (better) job you should write a blog post every day.
    21h35 I am not looking for a (better) job at the moment, but I always figured I'd like to write a blog.
    21h37 My current career goal is as follows : I'd like to learn how to program well and then start teaching what I've learned.
    21h37 I may as well try and start sharing what I have learned, so I'll try to write a small post each day in September.
    22h20 wrote my `g;` post, next let's publish that in a new repo on github
    22h47 it's up! https://github.com/nicoder/blog/blob/master/2013/09/01/g_semicolon.md

    21h14 third day, another vim command : Ctrl-D
    21h22 fun, i spend more time reading the help file than writing my daily post.



ideas : 
Ctrl-D (would do M and then Ctrl-F/B, but Ctrl-D and Ctrl-U does that)
J
gt and gT (along with :tabedit and :tabclose) (took me a while to use tabs in vim)
touch typing
Ctrl-V to change more than one line at a time in the same way
macros
q/
cw (along with n and .)
== (for example =i{ to indent body of a function)
ci"
%
/
f et t (et conjonction avec d, c, etc)
gUw
G and gg (example : dgg, dG)
u et Ctrl-R
:g/MY SEARCH STRING to show only those lines. e.g. :g/function => function definitions in php file
C (e.g changing elseif into else)
zz, zt and zb
:only to keep just one window open when split
