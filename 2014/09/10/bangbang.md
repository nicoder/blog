# !!

Here is a fun one I learnt about recently : `!!` repeats the last command in
some Unix shells.

When I need to do that I usually press the `Up` key to bring up the last
command and then `Enter` to execute it.

So not sure I will use it much but it is fun to know it exists.

Oh, I read [here](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1077) that
an interesting way to use it is `sudo !!`.

Oh, and [here](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/288) is an
interesting discussion of why the fish shell does not support it.

It mentions that a nice way to use it is after `time` or `strace` for example.

Oh, and I see [here](http://www.maketecheasier.com/mastering-the-bash-history/)
that you can do something like `!-5` to recall earlier commands...

Wow, and there are many "bang commands" that I did not know about, you can read about
them [here](http://www.softpanorama.org/Scripting/Shellorama/bash_command_history_reuse.shtml).
