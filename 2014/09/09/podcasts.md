# Podcasts I listen to

I started listening to software development podcasts around 2008. I often find
them fun and informative. Not being a native English speaker it is also a good
thing to listen to people speaking about software development in English
(I also listen to two podcasts in French).

It is a great way to find out about new technologies, to hear people sharing
their experience doing the same kind of work as you do as a software developer.

It is also a good way to learn about interesting people to then follow on
twitter or maybe meet in real life, at a conference for example.

It often gives me inspiration to learn stuff and / or try and do something
better with my skills.

The nice thing is you can listen to them while doing something else.
Charles Max Wood says he listens to podcasts while working.
I could not do that, but I listen to podcasts while washing the dishes, mowing
the lawn, walking to the store, ironing clothes.
