# cd

Here is another basic thing I (re?)learnt not that long ago.

I knew that `~` in a Unix shell resolves to the home directory.

So I used `cd ~` when I wanted to move to the home directory.

But `cd` (followed by `Enter`) does the same thing. And is shorter.
Especially on my keyboard where i have to type `Alt-n` to get the tilde.
