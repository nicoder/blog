# wroc_love.rb 2014 day 1

I managed to get a ticket to the Wroc_love.rb ruby conference in Wroclaw, like 2 days before the conference started...
So yesterday (Friday 14th of March 2014) I hopped on a bus to Wroclaw train station, and then walked to Kino Nowe Horizonty
where the first day took place.

I was there at 4p.m. and people started arriving through the afternoon. Had a nice conversation with Bogumir, Andrzej and Michal.
Fun to finally see in person people I only knew from twitter.
Fun to hear polish people talk about code, it has been nine years since I experienced that.

Around 8 p.m. we moved to a movie theater/room, and the 'soft skills' talks started.

Robert Pankowecki talked about 'Developers oriented project management'.
Small stories, prioritized, unassigned, work on the most important one first, async.
He wrote a book about it.

Marcin Stecki talked about how writing rails apps in 15 minutes is good for beginners but legacy code for real products, hard to test, understand and maintain.
I did not get every one of his points but it was a fun talk.

Piotr Misiurek then talked about soft skills and learning to talk to people : first to your neighbours about the weather, then in your company, ask questions at conferences, do lightning talks, and then real talks.
He got a lot of help out of Toastmasters.

Finally Jeppe Liisberg shared his story of failed startups, and placed much importance on 'the dip' (from Seth Godin's book).
It was very interesting to see him recall his experiences.

Looking forward to today's ruby/technical talks.
