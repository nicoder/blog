just some quick notes :

adam hawkins
- form objects
- models
- repository pattern => decoupling, fast tests
- validators

markus
- mutation testing
- change code => see if tests fail, if yes : killed mutant, if not : live mutant.

chastell
- isolates tests, test doubles, stubs, mocks, contract verification, bogus, rspec 3. fun(ny)

q & a markus & piotr solnica
- metrics, all or none, don't abuse, great learning experience, takes time

jan stepien moving to clojure
- immutability, repl, simpler to reason about code, performance, seamless between jvm languages

emanuele CQRS/ES
- has all the history, read db

lightning talks, nice stuff
