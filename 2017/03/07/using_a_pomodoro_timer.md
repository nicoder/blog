# using a pomodoro timer

I have been using parts of the Pomodoro technique off and on for the past ten years.

I use the 'easy' parts of the technique:
dividing parts of my work time into chunks of about 25 minutes of work and short breaks in between.

I have never really tried the planning/accountability part.

I read [Staffan NÃ¶teberg](https://twitter.com/staffannoteberg)'s book:
[Podoro Technique illustrated](https://pragprog.com/book/snfocus/pomodoro-technique-illustrated)
a while back, should probably read it again.

A mistake I made at the beginning is not stepping away from the computer during the breaks:
I would work 25 minutes and then read Twitter for 5 minutes.
I like reading what people write but it gets somewhat tiring after a while.

Now I like to use the breaks to do some strength training, dish washing, ironing.

It is still not a 'treat' as the method advocates,
but at least I step away from the computer
(and these little things get done).

At the beginning I would set a timer for 25 minutes of work,
and then another one for a 5 minutes break.
Then I found that it's simpler to only set the timer for the 25 minutes of work.

I used to use the timer on my phone,
but in January I installed a small/simple app called 'Tomato One' on my computer
to start the timer and notify me visually/audibly when the pomodoro is done.

It's a nice improvement,
I don't have to worry about the beeps waking up my family in the morning for example.

Sometimes I like to work on a problem for more than 25 minutes at a time,
to try to push and finish something,
but I find that often forcing myself to break it up in 25 minutes chunks
allows me to have interesting insights/ideas during the breaks.
