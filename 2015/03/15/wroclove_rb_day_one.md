# Wroc_love.rb 2015

This might be a long post where I record my impressions about this year's
[Wroc_love.rb conference](http://www.wrocloverb.com/), which took place in
Wrocław, March 13-15 (Friday to Sunday).

## before the conference

### CFP

I had been to this conference last year (2014), had a very good time and met or
learned about many interesting people who I then followed on Twitter during the
year.

While I was there I thought I wouldd really like to also give a talk at a
conference some day. Which is a bit strange because I am pretty introverted, to
say the least, and speaking to people, let alone more than one person at a
time, does not come easy to me. On top of that I had no idea what I could talk
about, especially given that I do not use Ruby professionally even if I like
what I know from the language and tools and community a lot.

Then in November (2014) I discovered Sonic Pi, a tool that allows you to create
music by writing code in Ruby, and I found it so much fun for playing music and
at the same time so promising as a tool for teaching programming that I wanted
to share it with people and a Ruby conference was a great venue for that.

So I replied to the Call For Proposals in early January (2015) and waited. I
told myself that I would be equally happy if the talk was accepted or not. I
really wanted to give it, but had it been turned down I think I might have felt
relieved to not have to give it :)

I started working on the talk anyway. I did it in an unusual way, sort of
inspired by [Chris Hunt](http://twitter.com/chrishunt)'s approach, which he
described on the
[Healthy Hacker podcast](http://www.healthyhacker.com/2014/10/20/speaking-at-conferences/).
I decided to go for a run every day, each time a bit longer, and to practice
delivering my talk from start to finish.

So I ran 2 minutes on January 1st, 4 minutes on Jan. 2nd, 6 minutes on Jan. 3rd,
and so on.

So on Feb. 4th when I received an email telling me the talk was accepted I had
already practiced delivering a 70 minutes version of the talk.

On Feb. 19th I ran 100 minutes and so the talk was an hour an forty minutes long
(a little less really, I did not really talk all that time).
It was getting heavy on my legs (I ran more than 100 km on the last week of
that experiment) so I decided to stop there.

### Twitter "drama"

I wrote the word "drama" in quotes here because some people do not like what
I am going to write about to be described with that word. It is one of the
problems with words, they have different meanings for different people (and also
in different contexts of course).

And in a tweet you have a limited amount of words you can use.

And if you are not a native English speaker you probably have an even harder
time finding the correct words.

From what I saw on Twitter, some people had two problems concerning this
conference :
* the conference did not (want to) have a Code of Conduct
* every speaker was male (and white)

#### Code of Conduct

Many conferences have been adopting codes of conducts as an attempt to be more
welcoming and ensure a better experience for their attendees.
Some people feel safer if the conference explicitely states what is OK and not
OK and what to do if something not OK happens.

The conference's website contained their idea of a code of conduct, in their own
words, but people on Twitter criticized it, saying it was not enough. A few days
before the conference a more fully-fleshed Code of Conduct was added to the
website, but by then the damage was done.

Some people say they avoided the conference (in part) because of that issue, I
find that sad. It does not cost much to add a Code of Conduct to your website.
You do have to think about how you will handle issues linked to that during the
conference, and I realize that dealing with them may be far from easy, but then
it is part of the responsabilities of a conference organizer i guess.

I wanted to try and talk with people who were against the idea of having a Code
of Conduct at the conference but did not manage to. I did not understand their
arguments on Twitter, but again it is not always the best place to have this
sort of conversation.

One thing that could be improved is that the conference Twitter account did not
participate at all in those Twitter conversations. It sure is not easy to do,
and it could have made things worse, but it did not feel like good PR to me.

I am not about to criticize the organisers, it is a huge commitment to organize
a conference on your free time, and I have not done it myself. I am very
thankful that they took the time to make this conference happen.

#### Diversity

##### Age

Alberto (Brandolini, [ziobrando](http://twitter.com/ziobrando)) made the remark
during his talk, he was one of the only people with gray hair in his beard, and
noted maybe one person of his age in the audience.

##### Gender

It seems to me there was maybe 10% of women at the conference. I have no data,
I could be far off.
But for sure there were 0% on stage (including lightning talks), 0% asking
questions after the talks (at last I did not see any ask questions).
5 (at least) were active on Twitter: [Cecile](http://twitter.com/cecilitse),
[Kasia](http://twitter.com/_idengager), [Gosia](http://twitter.com/gosiaczu),
[Agnieszka](http://twitter.com/proatut),
[Maria](http://twitter.com/mariastoklosa).

[Alex Coles](http://twitter.com/@myabc) who spoke last year at the conference
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/myabc/status/574522756617863168): "Attended last
three @wrocloverb  and loved it … but NOT A SINGLE WOMAN SPEAKER in four years
of existence is pathetic and inexcusable.".

As with many of the people who criticized the conference on Twitter I find his
words are harsh. But the situation is certainly concerning.

Again, I have no intention to criticize the organizers, people give examples of
more diverse lineups at conferences but I am sure it is not an easy thing for
everybody to pull off.

I hope this gender imbalance evolves in a good way and will try to see what I
can do to help make this happen.

## day 1

*Unicorn Magic tricks* by [Thorsten Ball](http://twitter.com/thorstenball):

I enjoyed the talk a lot. It was hard for me to concentrate at times (I will
blame that on lack of sleep and tension before giving my talk), so I did not
understand everything and would like to watch the talk again.

Thorsten told me he gave that talk before and wrote up [a thorough blog
post](http://thorstenball.com/blog/2014/11/20/unicorn-unix-magic-tricks/) on the
topic.

*What if clean code is a scam* by [Michal Taszycki](http://twitter.com/mehowte):

I enjoyed his talk, showing us a series of tweets of people who have different
opinions then a good part of the Ruby community (i.e. long methods and files,
OOP vs FP, svn vs git, ...)

I liked how he brought up the topic of diversity at the end too. Almost all of
the people he cited were male, and he asked if:
- we noticed?
- it bothered us?

*Lightning talks*

Lightning talks are always fun. I had heard about mapping the Shift keys to
left / right parens, and I have mapped my Caps key to Ctrl, but you can also map
it to Esc when you hit it on its own, good idea.

## day 2

*Volt* by [Ryan Stout](http://twitter.com/ryanstout)

Nicely delivered talk about the complexity in our web app stacks and how Volt
tries to address that. It made me think about how to reduce the complexity in my
app. And want to try out Volt of course.

There was a power outage at the end of his talk (fun coincidence, given the name
of the project), so we broke for lunch early.

*Trailblazer* by [Nick Sutterer](http://twitter.com/apotonick)

An interesting take on how to structure an application, and fun presentation.

*Post Rails World panel* with Ryan, Nick and Jim Gay

Fun and interesting, sort of two competing views : Trailblazer tries to improve
your app's structure on top of Rails, Volt replaces Rails altogether. Jim stood
up in place of [Luca Guidi](http://twitter.com/jodosha) of Lotus who could not
make it to the conference (and they referenced Lotus profusely).

Then came my talk, I was pleasantly surprised by how good I felt it was going
during the talk. Especially the live-coding demo parts.

Alberto Brandolini talked about Event Storming, finding your bottleneck and
focusing on that, lots of nice sound bites ("Ubiquitous Body Language"). I
enjoyed the references to various movies.

## day 3

*From Rails-way to modular architecture* by
[Ivan Nemytchenko](http://twitter.com/inemation)

Particularly enjoyed his drawings on the slides (and on Twitter during the
conference).

*Microservices* by [Sebastian Sogamoso](http://twitter.com/sebasoga)

Nice slides with pictures of the city, plus he had one of kittens since I had
said the day before during my talk that I was surprised nobody had shown any
yet. Interesting advice: two microservices should not talk to the same database.
Seems sensible when you think of it.

*Panel "DDD/CQRS/ES"* (@ziobrando, @andrzejkrzywda, @mpraglowski, @sebasoga)

I always enjoy seeing people discuss a topic like that. During the conversation
I noticed that the panel was composed of people from Italy, Poland and Colombia,
all conversing in English, fun.

*The Missing System* by [Jim Gay](http://twitter.com/saturnflyer)

Nice quotes, I liked the talk but think I did not understand everything, I could
have gotten more out of it, probably was a bit tired.

*ClojureScript + React.js* by [Norbert Wójtowicz](http://twitter.com/pithyless)

Very special talk, felt like Norbert dumped a number of projects and
technologies that I had for the most part never heard of. It seems worth
exploring, but overwhelming at the same time :)

## after the conference

I always get a lot of energy from conferences. Energy to want to learn more, to
become better at programming, to work on interesting projects.

Happy to have got a chance to talk briefly with Michal, Radek, Jim, Cécile,
Thomas, Mateusz, Andrzej, Robert, Wiktor, Rafał, Arek, Sebastian, Thorsten and others.
Would have liked to talk more with them and others.

Thanks again to the organizers and participants!
