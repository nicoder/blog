# Book review : "The VimL Primer"

TL-DR : I liked the book but don't have anything very specific to say about it.

I had heard about his book in the Pragmatic Bookshelf newsletter,
and I had looked at it a little, being very interested by the Vim text editor.

But at that time I had such a long backlog of ebooks I'd bought but not read yet
that I refrained from buying yet another one.

That said, when Ben Klein asked on the vim_use mailing list if anybody would be
interested in reviewing his book I jumped on the occasion, and so the book
leapfrogged the many others on my waiting list.

I started reading it right away, then got sidetracked, then started reading it
again, then again left it for a few months.
Finally I started again and read it all, a couple of pages a day, over a little
less than a month.

It's a pretty short book (about 60 pages), so you could really read it much
faster, in one or two evenings I guess.

I liked it a lot. It gives a good overview of the various things that can be
involved in making a Vim plugin.

The example the book used (interacting with a music library, displaying the
list of songs and playing them from the editor) is well-chosen, it's very easy
to get your head around and allows us to learn many aspects that might be
needed in a Vim plugin.

Not everybody will want to write a Vim plugin, but most Vim users will probaby
want to customize their .vimrc, and learning a bit about how plugins are
structured is interesting in its own way.
