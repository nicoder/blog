# Wroc_love.rb 2016 Sonic Pi Kata

Last weekend I went to the [Wroc_love.rb](http://www.wrocloverb.com/) Ruby
conference in Wroc≈Çaw.

On the first evening there were only three lightning talks (out of 12
five-minutes slots), and I thought 'oh, too bad I did not prepare something, I
could have done five minutes of live coding music with Sonic Pi.' Not that I
particularly enjoy doing that in public, but I have a lot of fun playing around
with it on my own, and I thought other rubyists would maybe want to try it out
and have fun too.

I did not feel comfortable just going on stage and improvising for five minutes.

But that evening at the hotel I played a little bit with Sonic Pi: started a loop,
added another one, and I liked what I came up with. And then I got this idea of
doing a 'Sonic Pi Kata': just like a code kata, the idea is to take a 'problem'
and solve it time after time, again and again, focusing on your tools, different
ways of solving it, speed of execution, etc.

So during the next day I practised playing the five minutes long live coded
piece a couple of times, and played it during the evening's lightning talks
session.

Then during the following week I spent five minutes every morning (after trying
[@waggi_tan](https://twitter.com/waggi_tan)'s meditation for five minutes)
playing the Kata again.

A week later, I recorded my morning kata, and here it is:

The idea of the piece of music was to show the basic elements of making music
with Sonic Pi, not to create a work of art. I am not a good live coder by any
means, for that check out the work of Sam Aaron and Joseph Wilk for example.

If you want to try it out, get the (free and open source) software from
[http://sonic-pi.net/](http://sonic-pi.net/) and maybe start with the built-in
tutorial.
