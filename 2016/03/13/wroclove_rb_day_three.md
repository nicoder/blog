# wroc_love.rb 2016 day three

Yesterday (Sunday March 13th 2016) was the third day of this year's wroc_love.rb conference in Wroclaw.

Oskar Szrajer talked about ROM (Ruby Object Mapper). I enjoyed his talk, nicely done, with examples and understandable diagrams.

Kacper Walanus talked about Consumer-Driven Contracts, a way to sort-of still use stubs for testing an API but validating that the stubbed format matches the provider's real thing.

During the break I had a nice conversation with Michal Czyz about what he does to teach high school (and some younger) in Bielsko Biala.

After the break a panel of Pawel Pacana, Michal Lomnicki, Tymon Tobolski and Sander van der Burg answered questions about Rails (well, not only Rails) deployment put up on a hackpad. Fun and informative.

Peter Bhat Harkins from Chicago talked about the Liskov Substition Principle and how he saw that as a more general pattern even when there is no inheritance.

Then Sebastian Sogamoso from Colombia told us a story about payments and the headaches / gotchas that come with it. I really liked the way he told a story, it made for a captivating talk.

There were 12 lightning talks, Tatiana told us how meditating for ten minutes at the beginning of her work day helped her overcome (or at least reduce) procrastination. Patrick showed us a tool to avoid 'guitar hero' merges (and the github merge PR button). I like the rebase and then merge approach for branches. Graph databases. Drugstock at Woodstock. Anton Paisov talked about making coffee. Pawel showed some examples of systemd.

Swistak wrote a program to randomly choose 5 of the lightning talks to give out five prag prog books. I talked with Pawel afterwards and hinted they could award Arkency books :)

Very nice conference again, the talks were good and the conversations even better.
