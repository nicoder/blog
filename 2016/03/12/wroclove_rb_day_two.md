# wroc_love.rb 2016 day two

Yesterday (Saturday March 12th 2016) was the second day of this year's wroc_love.rb conference in Wroclaw.

Basia talked about how to use R to find out which languages are more prevalent in github pull requests.

Robert Pankowecki talked about sagas. From what I understood it's a way to handle events, when an action should take place when a combination of events happens.

In the afternoon there was a 'panel' about code editors. Tatiana of Jetbrains showed RubyMine for a while (with Ruby and React code), then other peoples showed little things they liked about Vim, Spacemacs, Atom, Sublime.

Then Sander van der Burg talked about NixOS, very interesting, I had never heard of it before, a way to declaratively configure a system.

Then Wojciech Ziniewicz talked about ROS and the internet of things, I heard a lot of interesting things since IoT is a domain I know almost nothing about.

Many people signed up for the lightning talks this time, maybe 12 or 13. I played a Sonic Pi 'kata' for five minutes, I'd practiced during the day writing the same piece of music (I'd improvised / stumbled upon last night) maybe about ten times. It seemed to me the sound was distorted in the speakers but I still had good reactions afterwards, either people who liked it or people who told me they really wanted to try it. I liked @gosiaczu's talk about junior developers and psychology, adam niedzwiecki's talk about using etags instead of cookies. A guy of codebeat was pretty funny (but i don't really remember what he talked about, parsing programming languages, xml, IDL). A guy of lunar logic talked about a project to help with estimations, somebody else talked about client - developer relations (CPR communication, p..., respect ?). Someone showed examples of rubbish ruby code (and started some kind of contest?). Tatiana showed ten RubyMine tips.
