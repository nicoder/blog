# wroc_love.rb 2016 day one

Yesterday (Friday March 11th 2016) was the first day of this year's wroc_love.rb conference in Wroclaw.

It was nice seeing the familiar faces i met last year and the one before that.

It started with a React / Redux workshop. I arrived a little late for that (was
(just) on time at the bus stop but so the bus passing and not waiting a few seconds before i got there)

I used the time I had to to part of the ES6 katas (TODO link), very interesting to practice the new stuff I'd only read about.
Impressive what they managed to add to that version of JavaScript.

Next Andrzej Krywda gave a talk about slowly moving from a legacy rails application to DDD (Domain Driven Design). I enjoyed his talk.
Nice personal story of how he became his parents' CTO at the tender age of thirteen, and how he lost faith in all programmers when he encoutered a bug in software (and got informed of it by a yelling customer).
He advised to start by publishing events, that that will have the nice side effect of giving an audit log, but also allows to discern the agregates and bounded contexts of the system.
The next steps being Event Sourcing and Command Query (Responsibility ?) Separation

Then Elia Schito gave a talk about Opal. I really enjoyed his demo, he showed a game of TRETRIS (TM) written in opal/ruby and running in the terminal, and then showed how to adapt the code to make it work in the browser. He used TextMate and I especially liked a nice shortcut he had to change string quotation style.

There were only three lightning talks (of the ten or so spots available), which teaches me that I should have prepared one, i did not feel comfortable making something up on the spot.
@mrgrodo talked about docker cloud at cloudbeat
robert @pankowecki tried to make us install snapchat and follow him (saying we only put out a very carefully controlled image of ourselved on facebook and instagram)
and michal zajac (@michal_q_zajac (or maybe it was someone else ? may have misinterpreted a tweet)) showed a way to write haskell-like stuff in ruby

Nice conversations afterwards at the Zloty Pies, about programming and ruby and php and teaching / sharing, but also about climbing, kids, music, travelling the world.
